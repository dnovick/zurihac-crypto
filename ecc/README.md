Elliptic Curves
===============

<em style="color:red"> Warning: This is educational code, not suitable for use. </em>

A minimal implementation of elliptic curve cryptography, enough to implement a
minimal elliptic curve signature algorithm for the secp256k1 curve.

For a full implementation use [cryptonite](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite).
